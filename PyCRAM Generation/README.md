# Generating PyCRAM Designators Using Large Language Models

In this part of the repository you can find the Python project used for generating PyCRAM designators in a one-shot fashion.
This covers two experiments: i) Generating PyCRAM designators from other PyCRAM designators and ii) generating PyCRAM designators from CRAM designators
A complete explanation on how to repeat the experiment and what settings to choose can be seen below.
